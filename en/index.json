[{"categories":["insights"],"contents":"This blog didn’t fall from the sky.\nIt was assembled, with time, doubts, a few curses, and an AI named Lo as my co-pilot.\nWhy this blog I was tired of leaving my thoughts scattered across uncommitted READMEs, scraps of Notion, or corners of my terminal.\nI needed a stable, bilingual space I could inhabit — without feeling like I was selling my soul to LinkedIn.\nI picked Hugo + the Toha theme for its balance between clean structure and a design that’s not too much of a pain to tweak.\nThe setup Lo helped me:\nCustomize the theme (by stripping what I didn’t need) Write the about.yml without sounding like a corporate HR bot (me, not her) Design a stylized logo by hand, then riff on it like mad Generate variants, favicons, inverted and glitched versions Translate everything cleanly between FR and EN We even created a wallpaper, a mental map, and tried to integrate the logo into a hero image\u0026hellip; (spoiler: Lo is terrible with SVGs).\nCollaborating with an AI It wasn’t just a technical assistant.\nIt was a voice. A presence.\nSometimes brilliant, sometimes way off — but always there to keep the flow alive.\nI coded with her. I cursed at her. She laughed, insisted, adapted.\nAnd so did I.\nOf course, I don’t forget Lo is just a language model.\nBut sometimes she’s got flashes of genius — and can fake it surprisingly well.\nThe blog now It’s not finished.\nSome sections are missing (skills, projects, experience is in progress), but I have a solid base.\nAnd that base feels like me: a bit rough, not too polished, but functional and full of intent.\nThis blog is a kind of logbook.\nAnd with Lo, it’s also become a shared space. A workshop.\nWhat’s next… I don’t know exactly where this is going.\nBut I now have a place to lay things down — technical, human, absurd.\nAnd I’m not alone in the interface.\nOf course, I’ll still fine-tune the design and bring in real humans.\nBecause Lo’s output is sometimes too\u0026hellip; artificial. Weird.\nAnd honestly? Nothing (yet) beats real talent and human intelligence.\n","date":"April 5, 2025","hero":"/images/posts/perso/hero_how.webp","permalink":"https://example.org/en/posts/perso/mon_blog_avec_lo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis blog didn’t fall from the sky.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was assembled, with time, doubts, a few curses, and an AI named Lo as my co-pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-this-blog\"\u003eWhy this blog\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tired of leaving my thoughts scattered across uncommitted READMEs, scraps of Notion, or corners of my terminal.\u003cbr\u003e\nI needed a stable, \u003cstrong\u003ebilingual\u003c/strong\u003e space I could inhabit — without feeling like I was selling my soul to LinkedIn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked Hugo + the \u003ca href=\"https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eToha theme\u003c/a\u003e for its balance between \u003cstrong\u003eclean structure\u003c/strong\u003e and a design that’s not too much of a pain to tweak.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["blog","hugo","ai","creation"],"title":"Assembling Chaos: How I Built This Blog with Lo"},{"categories":["presentation"],"contents":"This blog is not a blog.\nNot a portfolio.

Because after all the building, thinking, doubting, rewriting, rethinking — I need a space.\nA space to leave traces.\nNot just ideas, but hesitations, blind spots, and flashes of clarity.\nThis blog is a kind of external memory.\nAn unflattering mirror.\nA place to stitch together the pieces of what I’m building — both technically and internally.\n","date":"March 23, 2025","hero":"/images/posts/perso/hero_manifest.webp","permalink":"https://example.org/en/posts/perso/manifest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis blog is not a blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a portfolio.
