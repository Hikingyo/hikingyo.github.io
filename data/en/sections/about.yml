# a summary about you
summary: |
  Linux Systems Engineer @ Ecritel.  
  I approach infrastructure and software like a craft — clean design, stable systems, no nonsense.
  Developer roots, DevOps habits, and a clear north star: becoming a software architect with intent and integrity.
  I believe in self-hosting, minimalism, and tools that do one thing well.
  Also: strong opinions, black olives, and a weakness for beautifully written code.
