This blog is not a blog.

Not a portfolio. Not a tutorial. Not a diary.  
It’s a place where I unfold what I think — when I need to.  
Sometimes it’s technical. Sometimes… not at all.

It’s a journal of exploration, partial memory, and sometimes deliberate contradiction.  
I write about projects I build (or abandon), thoughts that pass through me (or haunt me),  
and my attempts to understand how it all fits together — or doesn’t.

### Who I am (non-LinkedIn version)

I work in IT.  
I’ve been an art founder, a dev, a DevOps, a trainer. Now I’ve got one foot in sysadmin,  
and my mind already leaning toward software architecture. Maybe one day: Head of Engineering.

I like systems that hold together. And I love even more figuring out **why they don’t**.  
My mantras: **simplicity**, **resilience**, **autonomy**, **quality**, **industrialization**.  
I’m into well-crafted tools, scripts that do just enough, and stories I can slip inside without disappearing.

I write like I talk: sometimes blunt, sometimes twisted, always trying not to lie to myself too much.

### Why write here?

Because after all the building, thinking, doubting, rewriting, rethinking — I need a space.  
A space to **leave traces**.  
Not just ideas, but hesitations, blind spots, and flashes of clarity.

This blog is a kind of external memory.  
An unflattering mirror.  
A place to stitch together the pieces of what I’m building — both technically and internally.
