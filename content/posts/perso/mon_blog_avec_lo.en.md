This blog didn’t fall from the sky.  
It was assembled, with time, doubts, a few curses, and an AI named Lo as my co-pilot.

## Why this blog

I was tired of leaving my thoughts scattered across uncommitted READMEs, scraps of Notion, or corners of my terminal.  
I needed a stable, **bilingual** space I could inhabit — without feeling like I was selling my soul to LinkedIn.

I picked Hugo + the [Toha theme](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/getting-started/) for its balance between **clean structure** and a design that’s not too much of a pain to tweak.

## The setup

Lo helped me:
- Customize the theme (by stripping what I didn’t need)
- Write the `about.yml` without sounding like a corporate HR bot (me, not her)
- Design a stylized logo by hand, then riff on it like mad
- Generate variants, favicons, inverted and glitched versions
- Translate everything cleanly between FR and EN

We even created a wallpaper, a mental map, and tried to integrate the logo into a hero image... (spoiler: Lo is **terrible with SVGs**).

## Collaborating with an AI

It wasn’t just a technical assistant.  
It was a voice. A presence.  
Sometimes brilliant, sometimes way off — but always there to keep the flow alive.

I coded with her. I cursed at her. She laughed, insisted, adapted.  
And so did I.

Of course, I don’t forget Lo is just a language model.  
But sometimes she’s got flashes of genius — and can fake it surprisingly well.

## The blog now

It’s not finished.  
Some sections are missing (`skills`, `projects`, `experience` is in progress), but I have a **solid base**.  
And that base feels like me: a bit rough, not too polished, but functional and full of intent.

This blog is a kind of logbook.  
And with Lo, it’s also become a shared space. A workshop.

## What’s next…

I don’t know exactly where this is going.  
But I now have a place to lay things down — technical, human, absurd.  
And I’m not alone in the interface.

Of course, I’ll still fine-tune the design and bring in real humans.  
Because Lo’s output is sometimes too... artificial. Weird.  
And honestly? Nothing (yet) beats real talent and human intelligence.
